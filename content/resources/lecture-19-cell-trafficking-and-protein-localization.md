Description
-----------

Professor Imperiali talks about trafficking, or how things get to where they need to be within a cell. She will discuss the mechanisms by which proteins are coded very early on in their biogenesis, in order to go to certain locales in or out of the cell.

**Instructor:** Barbara Imperiali
